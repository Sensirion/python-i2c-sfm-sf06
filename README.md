Click [here](https://sensirion.com/products/product-categories/gas-flow-sensors/) to learn more about the Sensirion SFM-SF06 sensor family.


Not all sensors of this driver family support all measurements.
In case a measurement is not supported by all sensors, the products that
support it are listed in the API description.



## Supported sensor types

| Sensor name   | IÂ²C Addresses  |
| ------------- | -------------- |
|[SFM4300](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/?filter_series=77ed9322-c043-4eaf-ad3c-2b55aae69cdd)| **0x2A**, 0x2B, 0x2C, 0x2D|
|[SFM3119](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SFM3119/)| **0x29**|
|[SFM3003](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SEK-SFM3003/)| **0x28**, 0x2D|

The following instructions and examples use a *SFM4300*.



## Connect the sensor

You can connect your sensor over a [SEK-SensorBridge](https://developer.sensirion.com/sensirion-products/sek-sensorbridge/).
For special setups you find the sensor pinout in the section below.
